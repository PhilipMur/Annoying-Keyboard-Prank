# Annoying-Keyboard-Prank

A C# prank project, It uses a global keyboard hook so that you can map keystrokes to perform annoying tasks on a friend.
This project is intended as a prank and must not be used for Malicious Intenet as you will land yourself in trouble!!!!

You can map any key on a keyboard to perform a certain task,

Example.... 

I mapped the shift keys to display a message box,

the space bar to play system sounds,

the control keys to insert my own message to the clipboard (copy paste my message lol)

etc..

you get the picture.

You must add refrences to 

System.Windows.Forms
System.Speech.Synthesis

these must be added manually as this is a console application.

to make this project run in the background go to properties and change console application to windows application

to make this project NOT run in the background go to properties and change from windows application to console application.

Enjoy !! i only mapped a few basic keys as example.
